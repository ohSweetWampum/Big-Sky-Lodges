## Description

---

This hotel booking app, built with Node.js, Express, Sequelize, MySQL, and session management, is a full-stack application which offers a secure and user-friendly interface for managing hotel reservations across multiple branches. It enables users to securely register, login, book rooms, view their reservations on a personalized dashboard, and cancel bookings as needed. The app uses bcrypt for password encryption, ensuring high security. It employs Sequelize for smooth database interaction, and sessions for maintaining user states, providing a seamless user experience. The system checks for booking conflicts, preventing double reservations and ensuring efficient room management.

### Anime.js

```JavaScript
const hotelName = document.querySelector('.hotel-name');
anime({
  targets: hotelName,
  keyframes: [
    {translateY: -20},
    {translateX: 75},
    {translateY: 30},
    {translateX: 0},
    {translateY: 0}
  ],
  duration: 4000,
  easing: 'easeOutElastic(1, .8)',
});
```

### A router to post information

```JavaScript
// Check the availability of a specific room
router.post("/rooms/:id/availability", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    
  const { check_in_date, check_out_date } = req.body;
    // Check for conflicting reservations
    const conflictingReservations = await Reservation.count({
      where: {
        room_id: req.params.id,
        [Op.or]: [
          {
            check_in_date: {
              [Op.between]: [check_in_date, check_out_date],
            },
          },
          {
            check_out_date: {
              [Op.between]: [check_in_date, check_out_date],
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    });
    res.status(200).json(
      conflictingReservations
    );
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).json(err);
  }
});
```

### A router to render a page

```JavaScript
// Render room details page
router.get("/rooms/:id", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const roomData = await Room.findByPk(req.params.id);

    if (!roomData) {
      res.status(404).json({ message: "No room found with that id!" });
      return;
    }

    const room = roomData.get({ plain: true });

    res.render("roomDetails", {
      room,
      loggedIn: req.session.loggedIn,
    });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json(err);
  }
});
```

### Using the Session Module

```JavaScript
// signup a new user
router.post("/users/signup", async (req, res) => {
  console.log("Signup route called");
  try {
    console.log("Request body:", req.body);
    const signupUser = await User.create(req.body);

    req.session.save(() => {
      req.session.user_id = signupUser.id;
      req.session.username = signupUser.username;
      req.session.loggedIn = true;

      res.status(200).json(signupUser);
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(400).json({ message: "Sign-up failed.", error: err.message });
  }
});
```
