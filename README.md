## Code

I wanted to highlight this code snippet because it shows a helper function in action, and helper functions can ber very useful. Helper functions offer many benefits, such as improved code reusability, organization, error handling, and testing. By encapsulating a file reading logic in a helper function, the same code can be reused across multiple routes. This separation duties simplifies debugging and maintenance. Centralizing file reading logic enables consistent error handling, and any changes made will affect all parts of the application using the helper function. Here I have an example of using a helper function ( readFromFile) inside the delete note route, but I use this same function else wher in the code.

```JavaScript
// DELETE Route for a specific note
notes.delete('/notes/:id', (req, res) => {
  const noteId = req.params.id;
  console.log(noteId);

  // Use the helper function to read from the file
  readFromFile(dbPath)
    .then((data) => JSON.parse(data))
    .then((json) => {
      // Make a new array of all notes except the one with the ID provided in the URL
      const result = json.filter((note) => note.id !== noteId);

      // Save that array to the filesystem using the helper function
      writeToFile(dbPath, result);

      // Respond to the DELETE request
      res.json(`Item ${noteId} has been deleted `);
    });
});

```
